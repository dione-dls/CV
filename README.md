## Dione Estabillo

I am an enthusiastic, curious, and hard-working full stack junior developer. My background is in Finance and Supply Chain but I soon realized that a career in software development ticks all the boxes in my personal list of what a dream job should be. And my dream career reads something like this:

- intellectually stimulating
- allows room for creativity
- provides continuous opportunities for improvement


After dabbling with online coding tutorials, I have decided to accelerate my learning at Makers Academy and have since been looking forward to crafting something more functional and exciting than Excel spreadsheets.

I am very keen to work in a dynamic organization with a collaborative and supportive culture where I can add value while continuing to learn and grow.

## Skills

#### Quick and Independent Learner
In my previous role as a production coordinator, I took the initiative to do more than learn the basics of the ERP system used by the company to create and schedule work orders. I took it upon myself to build my competency to the point where I can use the system not only for the work that is required of me but to be competent enough to use it to cover for some of the tasks usually done by the production planner and inventory specialist when necessary.

#### Customer Service

The last job I held in the Philippines was more of a client-facing role. I worked for an insurance company which piloted a project of partnering with one of the biggest private banks in the Philippines to provide insurance-based estate planning solutions to high net-worth clients. My main responsibilities were to grow the high net-worth customer-base as well as to maintain relationships with existing clients and key personnel within the companyâ€™s private bank partner. It is in this role where I learned to put into practice the art of focusing on the customer as well as to be diplomatic and discreet in dealing with sensitive situations and confidential information.
