## Dione Estabillo

I am an enthusiastic, curious, and hard-working full stack junior developer with a love for both design and function.
My background is in Finance and Supply Chain but I realized that a career in software development ticks all the boxes in my personal list of what a dream career should be. And my dream career list reads something like this:

- intellectually stimulating
- allows room for creativity
- provides continuous opportunities for improvement


After dabbling with online coding tutorials, I have decided to accelerate my learning at Makers Academy and have since then been looking forward to crafting something more functional and exciting than Excel spreadsheets.

I am keen to work in a dynamic organization with a collaborative and supportive culture where I can add value whilst continuing to learn and grow.
