## Dione Estabillo

I am an enthusiastic, hard-working full stack junior developer in training with a love for both design and function.
My background is in Finance and Supply Chain but when I moved to London and craved for new challenges I decided 
to be bold and take steps to change my career path. My dream career reads something like this:

- intellectually stimulating
- allows room for creativity
- provides continuous opportunities for improvement
- in an in-demand and growing field

I realized that a career in web development meets all the requirements in my checklist so I set about teaching myself to code.
Makers Academy was the obvious choice for accelerating my learning and progressing me further toward my goal and after
graduating from this 16-week intensive coding bootcamp, I am keen to work in a dynamic organization with a collaborative and
supportive culture where I can add value while continuing to learn and grow.
