## Dione Estabillo

I am an enthusiastic, curious, and hard-working full stack junior developer. My background is in Finance and Supply Chain but I soon realized that a career in software development ticks all the boxes in my personal list of what a dream job should be. And my dream career reads something like this:

- intellectually stimulating
- allows room for creativity
- provides continuous opportunities for improvement


After dabbling with online coding tutorials, I have decided to accelerate my learning at Makers Academy and have since been excited about crafting something more functional and exciting than spreadsheet models.

I am very keen to work in a dynamic organization with a collaborative and supportive culture where I can add value while continuing to learn and grow.

## Skills

#### Quick and Independent Learner
In my previous role as a production coordinator, I took the initiative to do more than learn the basics of the ERP system used by the company to create and schedule work orders. I took it upon myself to build my competency to the point where I can use the system not only for the work that is required of me but to be competent enough to use it to cover for the other roles within my team.

Also, within a year, I was promoted to the role of production planner. In this new role, I planned and prepared the production schedules and managed finished goods inventory levels and staffing resources—tasks which I had very limited knowledge of to begin with. In this role, I have consistently achieved on-time delivery rates of 98.5% or better (with 100% being the perfect score). In addition, I have also completed a special project in which I have created a spreadsheet model which keeps track of the shop floor associates' skills, competencies, and training requirements—a tool which has been instrumental in helping management increase operating efficiency.

#### Analysis and Continuous Improvement

While working in a financial reporting role for a pharmaceutical company, I was assigned as the finance partner to remotely support the company’s commercial team in South Korea. In this job, the key focus was not only on preparing accurate and timely financial reports but also on streamlining financial processes and developing models to minimize inefficiencies in the financial reporting, budgeting, and planning exercises. My goal in this role was to tirelessly push for continuous process improvement and by the end of my assignment, a good number of redundant processes and reports have been eliminated and the work flow has become more efficient and simplified.

#### Customer-focused

The last job I held in the Philippines was a client-facing role. I worked for an insurance company which piloted a project of partnering with one of the biggest private banks in the country to provide insurance-based estate planning solutions to high net-worth clients. My main responsibilities were to grow the high net-worth customer-base as well as to maintain relationships with existing clients and key personnel within the company’s private bank partner. It is in this role where I learned to put into practice the art of focusing on the customer as well as to be diplomatic and discreet in dealing with sensitive situations and confidential information.
